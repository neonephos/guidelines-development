# Logo Requirements for new Projects

## Preamble

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED** and **MAY** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.html).

## Introduction

As a foundation, we bring together a diverse range of projects, each with its own mission, voice, and identity. Our visual ecosystem is therefore designed to support individuality within a shared framework, rather than enforcing a single, uniform look.

For this reason, there are no fixed color requirements for logos that become part of the foundation. We strongly encourage each project to retain its own visual personality. If your project is closely connected to, or builds upon an already existing project or logo within the foundation, you are welcome to align with a similar color scheme – this is optional, not a requirement.

Beyond this, we ask all logos to follow general, universally accepted logo design principles to ensure clarity, usability, and long-term consistency across digital and print applications:

- **Simplicity**: Logos should be clear, reduced, and easily recognizable.
- **Scalability**: The logo must work at very small and very large sizes.
- **Versatility**: It should function in color, and black & white.
- **Legibility**: Typography and symbols must remain readable across contexts.
- **Reproducibility**: The logo should work across digital, and print formats.
- **Timelessness**: Avoid trendy elements that may age quickly.

## Variants

**Multiple variants** of each logo **MUST** be created.
*Note: If a logo has a black color by design, then no colored variant is needed, i.e. this reduces the required RGB logo variants from 9 to 6.*

## Color Space

An RGB (for web & screens) and CMYK (for print) version **MUST** be provided for each icon version.

## Data Format

Each logo variant **MUST** be provided in plain SVG format.

These are the requirements for logo files:

- Logo Design in SVG
- Artboard: 1:1 (for icon)
- Placement: Horizontally and vertically centered
- Color Mode: RGB and CMYK
- Fonts: Converted to outlines and embedded
- Strokes: Converted to fills (no brushes)
- No masks / hidden paths
- Export as SVG in SVG 1.1-profile
