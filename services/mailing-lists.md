# Mailing Lists

The NeoNephos Foundation provides mailing lists to support project communication and collaboration.

## Default Setup

Each project can request the following mailing lists:

- **`{project}-discussion@lists.neonephos.org`** — Public mailing list for project discussion and announcements.
- **`{project}-tsc@lists.neonephos.org`** — Private discussion list restricted to TSC members only.
- **`{project}-security@lists.neonephos.org`** — Private discussion list for the project's security team. The generic security contact `security@PROJECTDOMAIN` forwards to this list.
- **`{project}-security-embargo@lists.neonephos.org`** — Private announcement-only mailing list for distributing security embargoes. The {project} TSC authorizes parties who may receive security embargo notifications, and they are added to this list.
