# Policies and Guidelines Development Repository

In this repository, we develop the policies and guidelines for the NeoNephos projects.

**Note: The documents in this repository are a work in progress and are not yet approved.**

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **[Project Policy Lifecycle](lifecycle-policy)** — Defines the lifecycle and governance model for NeoNephos projects. The Project Policy Lifecycle is binding for all NeoNephos projects; changes require approval from both the Governing Board and the TAC.
- **[Project Guidelines](project-guidelines)** — Guidelines for how projects should operate.
- **[Security Guidelines](security-guidelines)** — Guidelines for how projects should handle security reports and address security issues.
- **[Tools and Services](services)** — Guidelines and documentation for foundation-provided tools and services.
- **[Onboarding](onboarding)** - Guidelines for onboarding new projects to NeoNephos.
