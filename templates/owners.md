# Owners (Template)
*This is a template for an OWNERS.md file. Adjust as needed. Please note that for projects with
multiple repositories, it is sufficient if only the main repository or the organizational repository lists the TSC members. Do not confuse OWNERS.md with [CODEOWNERS.md](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners.md).*

- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](placeholder) for general contribution guidelines.
- See [GOVERNANCE.md](placeholder) for governance guidelines and maintainer responsibilities

This page contains all active and inactive TSC members. In addition, it includes additional roles such as the Security Officer.
